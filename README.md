Statistical visualization and analysis of cycling data

In GT_participant_analysis.r the the number of participants ending the three GTs (Giro, Tour, and Vuelta) between 1990 and 2018 were analyzed. There seem to be an ascending trend of more and more participant finishing the courses in the recent years. 1998 was the year when both Giro and Tour had about only 50% participants finishing the courses. The latter was affected by the Festina doping scandal.

GTs_time_gaps_1990-2019.py is a python file to visualize the time gaps between the first and the second cyclists in the three grand tours (GTs: Giro, Tour, and Vuelta) in the past 29 years. The data were resorted with pandas and plotted using seaborn and matplotlib.
